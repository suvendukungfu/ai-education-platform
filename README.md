## Vision

We are building the **AI Education Platform** because traditional LMS software is stuck in 2010. It’s static, clunky, and passive.

Our goal is simple: **Active Learning**. By embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the study workflow, we transform static PDFs into interactive conversations. Students don't just read; they quiz themselves, summarize complex topics, and get instant feedback—all in real-time.

---

## Core Features

- **Intelligent Study Materials**: Don't just upload PDFs. Talk to them. Our RAG pipeline allows students to query their textbooks as if they were chatting with a professor.
- **Always-On Tutor**: A context-aware assistant that knows exactly _which_ lesson you are studying and helps you get unblocked instantly.
- **Dynamic Quizzing**: The system generates unique quizzes every time, focusing on your weak spots (Adaptive Learning).
- **Insightful Analytics**: We track concept mastery, not just login times. Students can see exactly where they need to improve.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Role-based access control (RBAC) and encrypted data storage ensure privacy is never compromised.

## Tech Stack

We chose a stack that balances developer velocity with massive scalability.

| Component     | Technology                  | Why we chose it                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**  | React, TypeScript, Tailwind | Type safety and component reusability.                  |
| **Backend**   | Node.js (Express)           | Fast I/O for handling thousands of concurrent requests. |
| **AI Layer**  | Python, LangChain, OpenAI   | Python is the native tongue of AI.                      |
| **Database**  | PostgreSQL & Redis          | Reliability (SQL) meets Speed (Caching).                |
| **Vector DB** | Qdrant / Pinecone           | Essential for our RAG (search) capabilities.            |
| **DevOps**    | Docker, K8s                 | Write once, deploy anywhere.                            |

## Architecture

We didn't just throw this together. It's engineered to handle load.

### The 10,000-Foot View

Traffic flows through our Load Balancer into a robust API Gateway. From there, it's routed to specialized microservices.

> **Deep Dive**: Check out [System Design](docs/05_System_Design.md) for the full breakdown.

```

### The AI Engine (RAG)

How does it "know" the course material? It uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. We ingest documents, chunk them, embedding them, and then retrieve relevant context for every user query.

> **Learn More**: Read [AI Workflow](docs/06_AI_Workflow.md) to understand the brain of the operation.
